# Git for Web Development

### Git is a distributed version control system. What does that mean to a new web developer? It means that git is used to monitor and control code changes made during development across several people or teams.

### Git can be overwhelming at first, but if we break it down concept by concept, it starts to be clear why almost everyone in the industry uses it every day.

## At the end of this module, you should be able to:
* explain why we use the command line interface (CLI), and demonstrate use of basic CLI commands.
* sufficiently explain what version control and Git are, and why as software engineers we use them.
* demonstrate an ability to fork and clone a repo.
* understand branching, and be able to create a branch locally.
* explain and properly utilize the git commands: `status`, `add`, `commit`, and `push`
* submit a Pull Request.
* demonstrate their ability to use the Lambda School Git Workflow to submit an assignment to your Project Manager
